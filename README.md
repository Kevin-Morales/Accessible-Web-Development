# Welcome to Accessible Web Development

This is the official repository that holds the source code for the book Accessible Web Development.

This is an effort to teach blind persons how to develop web applications to decrease the number of the unemployed subset of the population in the United States.
It is also an effort to raise awareness of accessibility, and the impact that a line of code may have on the accessibility of parts or all of a website or application.
