# Introductory CSS


As we learned in our previous two chapters, the role of HTML is to describe the type of content we wish to have on a web page, and the impact if can have on screen readers when HTML elements and their attributes are used correctly or incorrectly.
In this chapter, we will learn about a language that makes it possible for HTML elements to look a certain way on a page.
The language we'll learn is known as CSS, an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets.
We will begin by describing a few preliminary concepts.
Afterwards, we'll introduce a CSS framework called Bootstrap, so we can get an idea of what is possible with CSS.
We'll then introduce the structure of CSS, and we'll end with resources on various CSS frameworks.
Along the way, we'll have case studies, so that visual concepts can be grasped better. For example, we'll look at how CSS is used to present a web application called JS Lint, targeted to computer programmers.
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to read and write CSS, understand crucial visual concepts, and navigate manuals for various CSS frameworks and libraries.

## What is a Style Sheet?

A style sheet is simply a set of rules that tell a web browser how HTML elements should look on a page.
Your favorite web browser comes with a default style sheet for every HTML element. We need style sheets so that our pages don't look as boring as the default style included with our browser of choice.
In order to make a style sheet, we first need to have a few ideas in mind, and this is where we begin to talk about two crucial topics: the page flow and the box model.
